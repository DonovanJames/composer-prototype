            With two lawsuits pending against the Metropolitan Museum of Art — both claiming that visitors are being defrauded by the strongly suggested but not actually mandatory $25 admission fee — the city has stepped in on the side of the business. In an amendment to the Met's original 1878 lease from the city (updated in 1971), the outgoing Bloomberg administration is clarifying that the museum can charge admission if it needs or wants to. The agreement 'authorizes the museum, should the need arise, to consider a range of admission modifications in future years, subject as in the past to review and approval by the City,' according to an announcement.

            , which does not speak officially for the government, said that giving up Snowden to the U.S. would be a 'face-losing outcome' for both China and Hong Kong. 'Unlike a common criminal, Snowden did not hurt anybody. His 'crime' is that he blew the whistle on the U.S. government's violation of civil rights,' said the paper, according to the

            With two lawsuits pending against the Metropolitan Museum of Art — both claiming that visitors are being defrauded by the strongly suggested but not actually mandatory $25 admission fee — the city has stepped in on the side of the business. In an amendment to the Met's original 1878 lease from the city (updated in 1971), the outgoing Bloomberg administration is clarifying that the museum can charge admission if it needs or wants to. The agreement 'authorizes the museum, should the need arise, to consider a range of admission modifications in future years, subject as in the past to review and approval by the City,' according to an announcement.
