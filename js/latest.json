Few shows lend themselves to a quote quiz as well as <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, with nearly 40 years of catchphrases to choose from. But do not get cocky: This <em>SNL </em>edition starts off easy, but then goes beyond the \"Isn't that special?\" gimmes into the deep cuts. The rules are simple. The game works Hangman style: You type in letters to fill in the quote that goes with the picture, but if you get more than three letters wrong, you lose that question. (If you're stuck, click for a hint on the upper-right-hand corner of each picture.) When you're done, share your final score on Twitter and Facebook to see if you&rsquo;d be worthy of your own\u00a0\"Weekend Update\" segment. On your mark, get set, quote!</p>"

The series has landed at Amazon Studios, and now just needs a showrunner and a pilot pickup to become a real show for the streaming service. The pilot script was written by <em>Skyfall</em>'s Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, and Nicolas Winding Refn and Martha de Laurentiis (widow of original <em>Barbarella</em> producer Dino De Laurentiis) are among the show's executive producers.

Joyce wore a shirt that said &ldquo;I \u2764 Life,&rdquo; because she excels at pointing out our more base emotions. Brandi showed up first, so it was weird when Van Dummy asked if they were friends and Joyce said yes. What a difference a week makes! Brandi is still standoffish, and not willing to tell any of her &ldquo;deep dark dad secrets,&rdquo; which just makes me wonder what the fuck kind of dad secrets are you hiding, girl? YoYo showed up ready to murder while Joyce flailed around in one boxing glove like a lobster with one claw, and told her own story of home invasion shortly after Gigi was born. Being rich sounds like a real pain in the taint, but YoYo handled her intruder like a person who comes from a land with no limos or gangs by putting on a shirt and <i>chasing after them</i>, promising to kill anyone who came near her kids. I believe you, YoYo! Even during the commercial break she said, &ldquo;I choke, you whip.&rdquo; Lisa showed up wearing two bras but her tits were still out, and Kyle immediately slut-shamed her by asking if she was <i>trying</i> to get attacked. Way to be a sister, Kyle! <br /> <br /> Van Dummy offered everyone the chance to choke him which was a little too autoerotic asphyxiat-ish for me. YoYo got up there, made his head turn purple, and thought that his tap outs meant for her to keep going, so she literally almost killed this man. I love that she said, &ldquo;He should have tried to pull my hand away,&rdquo; like, <em>Hey, if this guy didn&rsquo;t want to get murdered, he should have fought back</em>. When his color came back, he taught them all how to box, instructed them to always squeeze, and never kick the nuts if you are attacked, and was so mesmerized by Lisa&rsquo;s free-swinging boobs he got punched in the face. Kyle and Kim fought each other &mdash; she&rsquo;s a biter, Kim&rsquo;s a scratcher &mdash; and Carlton admitted that she once fought a woman in the gym for bumping into her before Brandi cracked her hand by punching Van Dummy in the dome. Everyone left feeling great now that they had a new way to channel their energy, proving that they are all Regina George from <i>Mean Girls</i> at heart. <br /> <br /> Lisa, Kyle, and Brandi went out for thank-god-we-didn&rsquo;t-let-YoYo-kill-anyone-today drinks, and Kyle gave Brandi a card to &ldquo;let her know she&rsquo;s really a friend.&rdquo; Way to keep your enemies closer, Kyle &mdash; I see you, Richards. I see you. Lisa wanted to leave from the moment her ass hit the chair, but she stayed long enough to play mother hen to Brandi about her potentially broken hand while Brandi shot daggers at her, resenting that Lisa finds her &ldquo;weakness to remind me that she&rsquo;s stronger than me.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know &mdash; Brandi seems to resist this mothering that she so clearly needs from time to time, and used to actually revel in &mdash; remember all the time she spent with Lisa and Ken last season, asking to be adopted?

The first set was disappointing &mdash; the women only had enough energy to jangle their hips for one or two full rotations, and the one in the black bathing suit was clearly swiped at by a lion across her lower half before showing up.

Carlton sat wide-eyed, babbling about &ldquo;lyrical beauty&rdquo; and someone who could &ldquo;work the pole in a positive way&rdquo; as this woman spun and twirled and <em>BAM!</em>, spread her legs and then <em>BAM!</em>, it&rsquo;s vagina central, and then <em>BAM!</em>, somehow her hair is the only thing attached to the pole and <i>she&rsquo;s still spinning</i>!

Much like season one&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come On,&rdquo; which introduced us to their curious coping mechanism, there&rsquo;s a lot at stake here, and similar to that episode, it doesn&rsquo;t end well. That Marshall threw up Lily&rsquo;s move to San Francisco took me by surprise. This issue hasn&rsquo;t resurfaced since they got back together in season two, but it&rsquo;s obviously the kind of history that would get dredged up during low moments. Hannigan did a great job expressing Lily&rsquo;s pain at having her dreams dismissed as &ldquo;a hobby&rdquo; by Marshall, especially when he goes for the soft underbelly and asks her if she really would have come back to him if things had gone better in California. (Lawyered!) That was certainly harsh, but bringing up her abrupt move was a fair counterpoint. Also, in terms of selfishness, I&rsquo;m surprised he didn&rsquo;t mention her credit-card debt.

According to MTV, Cyrus <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1720731/miley-cyrus-stripping-down-mtv-unplugged.jhtml\">will perform</a><i> Bangerz</i> hits like \"Wrecking Ball\" and \"We Can't Stop,\" which is kind of odd considering both \"Wrecking Ball\" and \"We Can't Stop\" are already fairly slow and pared down. Then again, literally any song would be better than \"4x4,\" which again, truly should not make Miley's episode of <i>Unplugged</i>.</p>"

Rather than a slouchy boot, Tilda opted for off-white textured tights with black-and-white patent pumps, making the look more <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/watch-9-videos-of-tilda-swinton-being-eccentric.html\">characteristically whimsical</a> than Western.&nbsp;</p>\n"

This went way <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/shameless-love-letter-to-the-man-bun.html\">beyond man-buns</a>: Designers like <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/thom-browne/\">Thom Browne</a> gave models animal heads made out of repurposed suit fabric, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/junya-watanabe/\" target=\"_blank\">Junya Watanabe</a> skinned several members of Fraggle Rock, and <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/alexander-wang/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Wang</a> drew inspiration from the smurf patriarch.

Ultimately the maneuvering may come down to who can best navigate the three-headed state Senate. De Blasio has the support of the regular Dems, and he seems to have lined up the backing of Jeff Klein, the leader of the Senate&rsquo;s rump Independent Democratic Conference. The swing votes could be a handful of Long Island Republican senators. Property taxes are the highest priority for Dean Skelos, the Senate co-majority leader, and his suburban caucus, but Cuomo is betting that the Republicans don&rsquo;t want responsibility for any kind of tax increase, even on city-dwelling rich people. De Blasio&rsquo;s camp believes it can leverage the Republican&rsquo;s slim hold on Senate leadership to argue that allowing the city to tax itself will free up state money for other suburban needs. All this may not be as entertaining as a Fort Lee traffic-jam scandal, but the next few weeks of New York politics should be plenty interesting.</p>"

This afternoon, Cuomo is unveiling a $1.5 billion plan that he says will provide all of New York&rsquo;s children greater access to pre-K and after-school programs. Cuomo&rsquo;s decision not to spell out the proposal early this month was smart, tactically: Instead of having the jockeying with De Blasio gobble up media space, Cuomo got the largely positive State of the State rollout he wanted, with plenty of attention, particularly upstate, being devoted to his plans for economic development. Then came the latest <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/poll-andrew-cuomo-new-york-reelection-102375.html\">Siena College poll</a>, which was in line with Cuomo&rsquo;s internal polling, showing the governor with a dominant 66 percent job-approval rating. More relevant to the pre-K debate was that Cuomo scored fairly well with liberal New Yorkers. On the other side of the aisle, the Trump-for-governor farce has highlighted the weakness of the state&rsquo;s Republican Party as Cuomo ramps up his reelection campaign. All of which reinforced the governor&rsquo;s longstanding belief, philosophically and politically, that the center is the best place for him to be: He scores progressive points by pushing for pre-K while at the same time buttressing his &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; credentials by funding it through the state budget.</p>\n"

Cuomo isn&rsquo;t trying to insult him, but he doesn&rsquo;t want to be associated with raising taxes in an election year. Simple as that.

He says wines like a Red Hook Winery Seneca Lake Riesling 2010 or Scholium Project Midan Al-Tahrir 2010 might accompany a Tokubetsu menu, while a wine like Maison Nicholas Perrin Condrieu Rhone 2010 might turn up with the Medatsu menu.

The building that houses the restaurant was originally built as a residence in 1833, but Vongerichten has fully restored it, keeping the original footprint and four working fireplaces.

Chefs are no different, often on the hunt for restaurant locations that afford plenty of space for less money and less hassle than what's available in New York. There are substantial trade-offs for people who open restaurants outside of Manhattan or Brooklyn, of course (things like fewer customers and decreased media exposure), but a small group of chefs has found what they say is a best-of-both-worlds situation 90 miles away from New York, in Philadelphia.",
                    "entryMore":"It's easy to think that people who leave New York couldn't hack it in the city's cutthroat restaurant environment. But recently, chefs are relocating just as they're poised to make it big here, opting for the comfort of Philly over <a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2012/09/why-successful-chefs-are-hitting-it-big-in-new-york.html\">potential celebrity in New York.</a> Peter Serpico left his justly celebrated role within the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/ma-peche/\">Momofuku</a> empire to open <a href=\"http://www.serpicoonsouth.com/\">Serpico</a> on South Street in June. Meanwhile, after two years working at <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/torrisi-italian-specialt/\">Torrisi Italian Specialties</a>, Eli Kulp was poised to become the executive chef and partner of a little restaurant called <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/carbone/\">Carbone</a> (perhaps you've heard of it?). Instead, Kulp teamed up with Ellen Yin&#8217;s sixteen-year-old Philly restaurant, <a href=\"http://www.forkrestaurant.com/\">Fork</a>, launched a spinoff called <a href=\"http://highstreetonmarket.com/\">High Street on Market</a>, and, most recently, got named the Philadelphia <i>Inquirer</i>'s <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2013-12-30/news/45677958_1_flavors-peter-serpico-spice#TqEUKFDRLlMgZEtp.99\">\"Chef of the Year.\"</a> So, what's the draw?\n\nFirst, the obvious: It's much cheaper to lease a restaurant in Philly. \"It's a bang for your buck down here, real-estate wise,\" Kulp says. \"For a retail property in Old City compared to the Lower East Side, it's about 50 to 60 percent less to operate in Philly when it comes to square footage.\" Naturally, this means operators can afford bigger spaces. Take <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/restaurant/fette-sau/\">Fette Sau</a>: The Philly outpost, which Joe Carroll opened in partnership with Stephen Starr in October 2012, is 7,000 square feet. The Brooklyn location is 1,200.\n\nBut the chefs say the comparison isn't so simple. \"Philly looks more affordable on paper, but it's not apples to apples,\" Kulp says. \"You might have less square footage in New York ... but the sheer number of people almost gives you an advantage there. There's a pocket of foodie types down here, but percentage wise, it doesn't even come close to New York &#133; I had to recalculate my perception of what volume is. In Philly, outside of Friday and Saturday nights, it's a challenge to fill up.\"\n\nSerpico agrees that the customers aren't nearly as dense as they are in New York &#8212; and all the chefs agree that Philly customers are also less susceptible to hype and buzz than New Yorkers, which can lead to unpredictable traffic. \"Our weekdays are really mad,\" says Serpico. \"It's so sporadic: We'll have 25 [covers] on the books and end up doing 45 &#133; and we get everyone at 7 p.m.\" Kulp says that while High Street maxes out on weekends, he often won't turn his tables on weekday nights. \n\nPhilly customers also tend not to spend as much money. \"You don't have the expendable income that you see in New York, so you have to be more creative in how you present your menu,\" Kulp says. High Street's menu focuses on $10-or-so sandwiches (duck meatballs and house-cured pastrami on bread made by a <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/stores/sullivan_st_bakery02/\">Sullivan Street Bakery</a> alum), and dinner dishes include $21 black-seaweed bucatini with lobster bottarga. \n\nSerpico agrees that Philly chefs can't list menu items the same way you would in New York. \"When we first opened, we did lamb ribs for two for $60,\" he says. \"And we were judged solely on that. Now, we offer lamb ribs for one for $29, and our menu is between $8 and $29. I think that's extremely affordable.\" \n\n<div class=\"entry-image wide\"><img alt=\"Philly\" src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/grub/2014/01/16/16-bialy-lamb-ribs.o.jpg/a_560x375.jpg\" width=\"560\" height=\"375\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 5px;\" /> <p> <p class=\"caption\">High Street's squid-ink bialy with smoked whitefish; Serpico's lamb ribs.<cite class=\"photo_credit\">Photo: Jason Varney; courtesy of Serpico</cite></p></div>\n\nLower menu prices are possible, though, because ingredients &#8212; from the many farms in nearby South Jersey, Lancaster, and Buck's Country &#8212; cost less than comparable products would in New York: \"If you're shopping in Union Square, you might pay $16 per pound for petite greens, young kale, or sprouting broccoli rabe,\" Kulp says. \"Those might be $5 per pound coming from the farms to us in Philly, and there are more products to choose from here. Not to mention, we call the farmers, they pick the vegetables, and they bring them to us. I'm not schlepping on the subway.\"\n\nStill, Pennsylvania's arcane liquor laws pose a challenge for Philly chefs. The state controls all of its wine and beer stores, and profits off of them. (Pennsylvania's actually the <a href=\"https://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/facts_and_figures/17500\">largest purchaser of alcohol</a> in the country.) Philly restaurateurs can't buy booze at wholesale rates; they pay retail like every other customer. As a result, restaurants are limited in how much they can mark up bottles. \"As an operator, it's a deterrent,\" Kulp says. \"If you're coming from another state, you think rent's cheap. And then &#8212; wait a second &#8212; you realize you can only make 75 percent margins on wine, compared to 200 or 300 percent &#133; It's almost controlled prohibition.\" But for Serpico, one benefit of these archaic, confusing laws is that he sells more cocktails.\n\nAll told, even though Philly is a short drive from Manhattan, doing business there can feel like a very different experience. That's why chefs like Serpico and Fette Sau's Joe Carroll partnered with Stephen Starr on their restaurants in Philly. \"I didn't want to come in here blindly,\" Serpico says. \"I wanted to open with someone who knew the market, and he's pretty successful.\"\n\nFor any new restaurant in Philly, Kulp says the trick is creating \"something that isn't going to intimidate people or make them feel like they're risking their money because it's so out of touch with what they might anticipate.\"\n\nBut he says there's still a bigger mental divide between New York and Philadelphia than there is an actual geographical divide: \"People in New York just don't go to Philadelphia,\" he says. \"But if it didn't work out down here, I figure I'd take the hour-and-fifteen-minute train ride. Once I realized how close Philadelphia is, it's not like you can never go back.\""

Or at least try. \"[I]t's something I have wanted to do for a few years,\" Garcia tells <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tony-blair-citizens-arrest-tramshed\"><em>Vice</em></a>, explaining that he &#8212; like <a href=\"http://www.arrestblair.org/\">others</a> &#8212; wants people like Blair and former President George W. Bush to be tried for war crimes against the Iraqi people. So, he explains, the politician and his family were working through drinks and entr\u00e9es on Friday night when Garcia got all intrepid and tapped Blair on the shoulder. \"Mr. Blair, this is a citizen's arrest for a crime against peace, namely your decision to launch an unprovoked war against Iraq. I am inviting you to accompany me to a police station to answer the charge,\" he said. \"No,\" Blair responded, apparently without missing a beat or budging. \"Shouldn't you be worried about Syria?\" he asked, and, well ... awkward!",
                    "entryMore":"After Garcia explained that he preferred to take his geopolitical concerns one country at a time, Blair asked Garcia if he considered Saddam Hussein to have been a brutal dictator, then talked about \"how lots of people died in the 1980s.\" After responding something-something-illegal-war-something, Garcia says Blair changed tact. \"I think you should be more concerned about Syria, to be honest,\" he said. \n\nSecurity reportedly showed up by the time Garcia decided he didn't want to talk about Syria, and it's not really clear whether Blair and his party got desserts, just or otherwise. Today, however, his office issued this statement regarding the \"great time\" he had at Tramshed:\n\n<blockquote>\n\nThere is nothing to report here apart from fact that Mr Blair did offer to discuss the issue - that offer was declined and the individual walked off. Nothing else happened. Everyone is fine and they had a great time at the restaurant.</blockquote>\n\nMeanwhile, the <em>Independent</em> reports, the webmaster of <a href=\"http://www.arrestblair.org/\">arrestblair.org</a>, which offers a bounty for anyone who confronts the former Prime Minister, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tony-blair-subjected-to-humiliating-citizens-arrest-at-tramshed-restaurant-shoreditch-9073064.html\">says that Garcia has already put in his claim for $3,500</a>. In the meantime, Garcia says he quit his front-of-house job at Tramshed on the spot. \"It all panned out pretty much how I thought it would,\" he tells <em>Vice</em>, \"except that I didn't expect him to start debating with me.\" \n\n<a href=\"http://www.vice.com/read/tony-blair-citizens-arrest-tramshed\">My Boyfriend Just Tried to Citizen's Arrest Tony Blair </a>[Vice]\n<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tony-blair-subjected-to-humiliating-citizens-arrest-at-tramshed-restaurant-shoreditch-9073064.html\">Tony Blair subjected to humiliating citizen's arrest at Tramshed restaurant, Shoreditch </a>[Independent UK]"

                    "entryText":"By now, you have heard of <a href=\"http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/01/diamond-horseshoe-opens.html\"><i>Queen of the Night</i></a>, the circus-opera-dinner-performance showpiece from <a href=\"http://nymag.com/listings/theater/sleep-no-more/\"><i>Sleep No More</i></a>'s Randy Weiner that's currently running in the reopened Diamond Horseshoe. You've possibly even tried to buy tickets for the six-week run but have found them to be somewhat difficult to procure. No matter: It is running and people seem to be very impressed with it. We will leave analysis of the show itself to more theatrically minded writers. As with all aspects of life, Grub is most interested in the food. ",
                    "entryMore":"A quick explanation: The food itself is just one part of the entire show, and other reports have touched on it. But chef Jason Kallert (who, we should mention, is married to Grub photographer Melissa Hom) and director of food performance Jennifer Rubell (who is not married to anyone on Grub's staff, but who did once <a href=\"http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/jennifer-rubell-2011-7/\">allow herself to be covered in honey for <i>New York</i></a>) have been somewhat secretive about what, exactly, their collaborative menu entails.\n\nTurns out the prevailing culinary theme of the meal is: food that everyone loves, presented in a totally over-the-top fashion. \"The level of ambition of the food performance bumped up against absolute constraints,\" Rubell says. \"And Jason's been really good at pushing every one of those constraints to the limit.\" These are the kinds of things Grub Street likes to hear. \n\nSo how did the meal &#8212; which is integrated into the show itself &#8212; come together? \"I'm collaborating with Jason,\" Rubell explains. \"He does everything up to the kitchen door, and I do everything after that.\" But that's not 100 percent accurate, because one discipline informs the other. For example, Rubell says, \"There's something we call the food parade, so I might work with the choreographers to bring that into existence, but lines get blurry, because, in order to do a parade where food for 220 people comes out in one minute, everything feeds into that &#8212; the menu, what to make, how to make it, so it's not entirely fair to say Jason's work is only in the kitchen.\"\n\nAs you can tell, it's all sort of hard to ... <i>describe</i>. But that's the point. \"I'm excited to be part of something that has this kind of exuberance,\" Rubell says, \"that you cannot put in a box.\" So, yes, no boxes, especially where the food is concerned. But there are plenty of skewers and rotisseries and even birdcages full of lobster.
